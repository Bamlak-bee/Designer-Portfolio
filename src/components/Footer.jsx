                Hello there! I'm Bamlak, a passionate Junior UI/UX designer who finds inspiration in the art of transforming a blank canvas into something stunning. For me, design is not just a profession; it's an opportunity to create something beautiful, functional, and memorable that resonates with people.

                My journey into the world of design has been exhilarating. I believe it started when I was handed a pencil. Even before I knew what I was getting into, I was keen on making anything beautiful and pleasing to the eyes - be it my notebook or even my table. The tiny scribbles and doodles turned into a hobby, that I couldnâ€™t put a name to it. Later when I embarked on a computer science degree journey, which was also driven by the curiosity of finding out how things worked and to always keep my self up to date on revolutionary things,  I was able to discovery the world of digital designing.

                While I'm a Junior UI/UX designer, my passion for growth and learning drives me to continuously refine my skills and stay up-to-date with the latest design trends and technologies. Every day is an opportunity for me to expand my knowledge and take on exciting challenges.

                When I'm not immersed in the world of design, I am reading, watching cooking videos or doing something crafty.  These varied interests not only provide a welcome escape but also infuse my work with fresh ideas and perspectives.

                Let's connect and explore the possibilities of crafting exceptional designs together!
